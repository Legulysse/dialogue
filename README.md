# ![Icon](/Icons/led24/bookmark_book.png) Dialogue Editor 1.3
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

A Dialogue Editor for branching dialogues, built in C# and mainly based on WinForms.  

The Editor is designed for large scale production, primarily targeting the needs of writers and game designers.  
It is based on individual Json files for easy integration in any game engine, and provides import/export pipelines for localization and voicing.  

The main goal of the tool is to provide consistent and dependable unique IDs on every sentence in the project, to allow easier and safer iterations on localization and voicing, even for already integrated dialogues.  
It is designed as a backbone for automated staged dialogues, with very minimal camera and animation options.  

What it does NOT do, is to provide tools for timelines and advanced staged dialogues.    
You can, however, plug the exported data on top of your game engine timelines.

The tool has been created at Cyanide for its various projects needs.  
It is mostly inspired by the tools used on Cyanide's Game of Thrones RPG, and the Aurora tool used on Neverwinter Nights.
